TDD: Test Driven Development
 ->TestNg
 ->Junit
  you don't have to rely on main method to execute your test cases
  you can also generate report using testNg/Junit
   3As --> @annotations, attributes, assertions
           @annotations:
              will always start with @
              We can use annotations along with methods
              @BeforeSuite:This will be executed before @BeforeTest and only once
              @BeforeTest: This will be executed before @BeforeClass and only once
              @BeforeClass: This will be executed before @BeforeMethod and only once
              @BeforeMethod: This will be executed before every test case [@Test]
              @Test: This is used to represent test case
              @AfterMethod: This will be executed after every test case [@Test]
              @AfterClass:This will be executed after @AfterMethod and only once
              @AfterTest:This will be executed after @AfterClass and only once
              @AfterSuite:This will be executed after @AfterTest and only once
              =====================================================================================
           attributes:
              we can use attributes along with annotations
              priority: this is used to set the execution order of your test cases
              enabled{true/false} : this is used to enable(true) or disable(false) any test case execution
              dependsOnMethods: This will execute only if depending method is passed, else this TC will be skipped
              alwaysRun: This will always run your TC, no other condition can override this
              invocationCount: This will execute the test case, n number of times
              groups: This helps in grouping the Test Cases
              dependsONGroups: This will execute only if all the test cases of a particular group passes else this will be skipped
              timeout:Test case will fail if it is not executed within given time.
              =====================================================================================
           assertions:
              we will use assertions to validate anything
              assertEquals
              assertNotEquals
              assertTrue
              assertFalse
              Hard Assertion Vs Soft Assertions

              @DataProvider
              Generate Report in testNG from IDE
              ===================================================================================
              Run Test Cases and Generate report using xml file.
