TDD: Test Driven Development
 ->TestNg
 ->Junit
  you don't have to rely on main method to execute your test cases
  you can also generate report using testNg/Junit
   3As --> @annotations, attributes, assertions
           @annotations:
              will always start with @
              We can use annotations along with methods
              @BeforeSuite:This will be executed before @BeforeTest and only once
              @BeforeTest: This will be executed before @BeforeClass and only once
              @BeforeClass: This will be executed before @BeforeMethod and only once
              @BeforeMethod: This will be executed before every test case [@Test]
              @Test: This is used to represent test case
              @AfterMethod: This will be executed after every test case [@Test]
              @AfterClass:This will be executed after @AfterMethod and only once
              @AfterTest:This will be executed after @AfterClass and only once
              @AfterSuite:This will be executed after @AfterTest and only once

           attributes:
              we can use attributes along with annotations
              priority
              enabled
              dependsOnMethods
              groups
              dependsONGroups
              alwaysRun
              invocationCount
              timeout
              =====================================================================================
           assertions:
              we will use assertions to validate anything
              assertEquals
              assertNotEquals
              assertTrue
              assertFalse

              Run Test Cases and Generate report using xml file.
