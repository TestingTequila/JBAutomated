  you don't have to rely on main method to execute your test cases
   3As --> @annotations, attributes, assertions
           @annotations:
              will always start with @
              We can use annotations along with methods
              @BeforeSuite
              @BeforeTest
              @BeforeClass
              @BeforeMethod
              @Test
              @AfterMethod
              @AfterClass
              @AfterTest
              @AfterSuite
              -----------
              @DataProvider
              @Parameter
              =====================================================================================
           attributes:
              we can use attributes along with annotations
              priority
              enabled
              dependsOnMethods
              groups
              dependsONGroups
              alwaysRun
              invocationCount
              timeout
              =====================================================================================
           assertions:
              we will use assertions to validate anything
              assertEquals
              assertNotEquals
              assertTrue
              assertFalse
