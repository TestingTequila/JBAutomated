        //ChromeDriver driver=new ChromeDriver();
        //FirefoxDriver driver=new FirefoxDriver();
        //EdgeDriver driver = new EdgeDriver();
        //SafariDriver driver = new SafariDriver();

        //Design Pattern:
          //1. POM[Page Object Model]
               For every page, we should create a separate class file and every action on that page should be defined
               as method within this class file
